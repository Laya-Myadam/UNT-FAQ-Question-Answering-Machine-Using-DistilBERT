Question,Answer
How is a policy action initiated at the University Policy Office?,"A policy action at the University Policy Office is initiated through a six-year review conducted by the office. The outcomes of this review can include a review without revision, revision, or deletion of the policy. If there's a need to amend an existing policy, the policy contact or owner can initiate the process by submitting a request via email to policy@unt.edu, along with a draft of the policy document using the Track Changes feature in Word. For creating a new policy, the responsible executive identifies a need, selects a policy contact and owner, and submits a draft using the policy template."
What is the difference between a policy and a procedure?,"A policy states ""Why"" the institution takes certain positions on an issue, while a procedure outlines ""How"" the institution will implement this policy position. In summary, policies provide the reasoning behind decisions, while procedures detail the steps to implement those decisions."
On average how long does it take to complete a policy action?,"The duration of a policy action varies. Minor changes, like updates to contact information, may take a few business days. However, substantive changes to the policy itself typically involve a thorough six-step review process, taking about twelve (12) weeks or more. The complexity of the action can influence the duration, and occasionally, there might be urgency due to accreditation, system, state, or federal deadlines."
What happens after I submit a policy draft to the University Policy Office?,"The University Policy Office (UPO) will review the submitted draft, provide feedback or edits if necessary, and initiate the routing process. This process ensures the policy draft meets prescribed standards and addresses any feedback concerns with the owner. The detailed processes can be found on the UPO's Policy Processes page."
Who should I contact if I have questions about the content of a policy?,"For questions regarding the content of a policy, the best person to contact is the Policy Contact listed on the policy's web page. This information can be found by browsing or searching the Policy Manual for the specific policy in question."
Where can I find previously approved versions of a policy?,"The University Policy Office works with the Records Management Program and the University Archives to maintain older versions of UNT policies. The University Archives is the primary source for older policy versions, but if needed, UPO staff can also check internal records to accommodate requests."
What is the purpose of the legal sufficiency review in the policy process?,"The legal sufficiency review, conducted by the UNT Office of General Counsel (OGC), analyzes policies to ensure consistency with applicable law, identify and address legal risks, and improve legal defensibility. This review is a crucial step in the policy development process."
What distinguishes a substantive change from a non-substantive change in a policy?,"A ""substantive change"" modifies the meaning and interpretation of the policy, such as adding or deleting a definition, changing a responsible party, or revising text that alters the scope of applicability. In contrast, a ""non-substantive change"" includes adjustments like font and paragraph changes, page numbering, and policy number modifications."
How can I determine when a policy was last updated?,"The initial approval date and revision history of each policy are located at the bottom of the document. Additionally, recent policy updates can be found on the Policy Updates page, providing information on the latest changes."
Are there any rules regarding posting UNT policy on departmental web pages?,"To ensure proper updating and consistency, only one version of a University-wide policy may exist, residing within the University Policy Manual on the official policy page. If departments want to reference a UNT policy on their web page, they should link back to the official policy page within the University Policy Manual."
How many credits am I taking?,"INFO 5000, INFO 5200, and INFO 5600 are each three credits."
How many credits can I handle?,"It is recommended that all students, except those in the School Library Certification, begin their master’s program with INFO 5000. You may take 5000 with either or both of the other core courses, 5200 or 5600. You may take other courses concurrently with the core courses with the approval of your advisor. Keep in mind that INFO 5200 and 5600 are considered two of the more labor-intensive courses offered and it is not recommended that they be taken concurrently. Part-time enrollment at the graduate level is considered to be six credit hours or fewer per semester. Full-time enrollment is at least nine credits per semester. At the Master’s level you should expect to spend four hours outside of class for every credit hour you take. For example, if you are taking 5000 and 5600, a total of six credit hours, you should expect to spend 25 hours per week on coursework."
When do I need to be on campus for an Institute? Can I leave early?,"The agenda for each class is posted on the Onsite Institute website. In general all classes meet from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and, because these institutes provide the foundation for the remainder of the course which is delivered online, you are required to attend the entire time."
Are there other ways to get involved in the Department of Information Science community?,"All students in the Department of Information Science are encouraged to subscribe to the official department listserv LIS-ANNOUNCE-L. This list is for announcements only, not discussion. It is through this listserv that you will be notified of official department business including external employment postings, conference notifications, student and alumni activities, and other related department business. Joining IS-Announce is easy. Just send an email to is-announce-join@lists.unt.edu, leave the subject line and the body of the email blank. The Department is also active on social media. Consider following us on Facebook and Twitter for updates and information."
Whats an EUID?,"An EUID is a unique electronic user identifier that is assigned to all UNT students, faculty and staff—it is not your eight-digit student ID. The EUID will have your initials followed by four digits. Shortly after you are cleared to register by the graduate department, your EUID will be created by the UNT Computing Center. Your EUID will allow you access to WebCT, WebReg, and the UNT Library’s electronic resources, among other things. Find your EUID and other remote access help through your MyUNT page."
Where can I get information about financial aid?,"Financial Aid is administered by UNT. Apply for financial aid through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/. Find out more about financial aid at UNT at the Financial Aid website."
Where can I get information about my tuition and fees?,"Questions about tuition and fees should be addressed to Student Financial Services."
How do I find out about other Department of Information Science courses?,"The Department of Information Science website is the main source of information about the department's degrees, programs, and courses."

Will Canvas be unavailable because of maintenance at a consistent time during the week?,"Instructure performs maintenance on the 1st and 3rd Thursday of each month between 1:05 am and 3:05 am if necessary. Even though the maintenance window is scheduled for 2 hours, users are not likely to experience downtime for more than a few minutes, however users should plan to schedule their activities accordingly."
How do I select my personal pronouns or change my display name in Canvas?,"Personal pronouns display after your name in various areas in Canvas, including: Comment Fields, Discussions, Inbox, User Navigation Menu, User Profile Page, User Settings Page 1.

Why can't students see my course?,"There could be several different reasons why students cannot see a course or a course's content: Either the course or the course content is unpublished. To ensure your course is published, check that the Published button on your course's home page in the right Sidebar is green. To ensure your course's content is published, check that the modules, assignments, quizzes, etc. have a green checkmark next to them. The semester hasn't started yet. Although students are populated one week before the semester start date, students can only access the course content on the first class day unless the course settings have been adjusted (see Canvas Settings (Instructors) and Adjust Course Dates (Students)). The student is not yet registered. To check to see if the student is registered, click the People link on the course navigation menu. If the student is registered, the student's name will appear on the People page and there will be a checkmark next to the student's name. The student has dropped or withdrawn from the course. To check to see if the student is still registered, click the People link on the course navigation menu. If the student is not registered, the student's name will not appear on the People page."
Can I get advised over the phone or email?,"If you have specific questions, you will need to make an appointment with an advisor. You may email an advisor, but due to legal reasons, email advising is limited only to general questions. An on-call advisor is also available every day to answer general questions over the phone (940) 565-2110."
What are my advising options if I'm not able to meet with an academic advisor during standard office hours?,"If you aren't able to meet with an advisor in-person during our traditional appointment hours, please call the office to inquire about alternative online advising options."
What are my responsibilities?,"1. Knowing and observing all prerequisite requirements as listed in the most recently published Undergraduate Catalog.

If you have a copy of your worksheet, audit, or degree plan, you may want to bring it with you to verify that it is the same as that in the Advising Office. Bring possible schedule options after reviewing your online degree audit."
Can I request a specific advisor?,"You are encouraged to develop a relationship with your advisor. Academic Advisors are an important contact during your college career. If you would like to make an appointment with a particular advisor, you must tell the receptionist when scheduling your appointment."
I am being asked to enter a code. How do I get my code?,"All first-time in college and Pre-Business (PBUS) students, as well as those on academic alert or probation, are required to meet with an Academic Advisor to discuss your degree progression and obtain a code to register."
How do I register for an Internship?,"Contact Brian Hirsch with the Career Resource Center to begin the process and discussion regarding an internship. If approved for an internship, you will be given directions on how to register for the course."
I can't register for upper-level business courses.,"Students classified as BUND (Business Undecided) are blocked from enrolling in upper-level (3000-4000 level) business courses. If you are (or will be) eligible for upper-level business courses for the next semester, you must meet with an advisor prior to registration to have the block removed."
I am getting a message that says 'Maximum Term Unit Load Exceeded'.,"If you get this message, you have tried to register for more than the maximum number of hours allowed for that term. An advisor can approve an overload if you meet the qualifications listed in the UNT catalog in the enrollment section under Student Load."
What do I do if the class I am trying to register for is full?,"The Advising Office cannot add you to courses that are full. You can always check with individual departments to see if a waiting list is being offered. Continue to check for course availability throughout schedule revision and Add/Drop registration periods."
Are evening online or Saturday classes available?,"Conduct an advanced search for options using my.unt.edu. Instructions for viewing evening and weekend and online options are available."
PBUS and BUND Majors:,"Pre-Business (PBUS) and Business Undecided (BUND) majors are blocked from registering from all upper-level business courses.

How can I or my child feel safe on this campus?,"Overall, here at UNT, the violent crime rate is actually fairly low, especially given the size of the community and the institution. It’s highly likely that if you’re victimized by someone, it will be a theft of some kind. Engrave your driver’s license number on items like laptops, TVs or bicycles or at the very least, take photos of all your serial numbers and upload them to the cloud. Keep your cars clean and locked and also work out with your roommates and suitemates that all residence hall doors should stay locked at all times! Other than that, keep a charged cell phone on you at all times, keep your head up and be aware of your surroundings, and immediately report any suspicious persons or activity to the UNT Police."
What things can I carry or can my child bring to campus for their protection?,"This can get complicated quickly. There are things you can do or carry in public or at UNT that are legal but may be otherwise prohibited by other policies. For example, you can carry a pocketknife at UNT but they are prohibited in the residence halls. Concealed handguns in certain residence halls are allowed, but the Texas LTC (License to Carry) has a minimum age requirement of 21 eliminating that choice for many. In general, we often recommend a good quality pepper spray. You can contact one of us for guidance and more discussion. Reach out to our community relations person found on this web site. Don’t forget that general awareness and good personal safety habits are also important tools."
What is the crime rate on campus?,"The Jeanne Clery Act requires institutions of higher education to annually compile and report on “Clery” crimes occurring within our “Clery geography.” Generally, these are your more violent offenses plus things such as alcohol and drug arrests or disciplinary referrals and dating/family violence. To see the statistics for the most recent three calendar years, go to https://clery.unt.edu and peruse the Annual Security & Fire Safety Report (ASFSR). In general, based on the last information available to us, our crime rate is lower than that of similarly sized institutions."
Is there anything safety-wise in place to protect students on campus in an emergency situation?,"Absolutely. All students are automatically enrolled in “Eagle Alert,” our emergency message notifications. The Clery Act requires us to notify the campus community of certain ongoing threats or emergency situations. Some may arrive by email but emergent and still ongoing or developing situations may be delivered by text messaging, phone calls, and classroom computer screen take-overs. In addition to simply being notified, students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the RUN-HIDE-FIGHT philosophy as demonstrated here: https://police.unt.edu/active_shooter"
Do you provide any type of training programs related to safety for students on campus?,"Yes, we do, and they’re all free! A sample list of some of our offerings can be found here: https://police.unt.edu/safety. However, custom courses can be set up for you or your student groups if you contact us well in advance of your expected timeframe. Call the community relations officer listed in the link above to discuss your options. The best way to see what is already being offered throughout the semester is to follow our social media accounts…we’re on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. We’ll post class offerings there as well as they occur."
Can I or my child carry a handgun on campus?,"It depends. There is lots of good information and more FAQs here: https://www.unt.edu/campus-carry For those wishing to carry a concealed handgun on the premises of UNT (in buildings), they must have a Texas License to Carry (LTC). LTC holders are still prohibited from carrying in certain areas that are marked with the requisite signage. If after you’ve reviewed the materials linked above you have a more specific situation or would like to talk further, please reach out to us at unt.police@unt.edu."
A post on social media involving UNT Police seems to have raised questions. What is being done or why don’t you fully explain yourselves?,"While we use social media liberally to promote proactive safety measures, we also know that, at times, posts may be misinterpreted or not fully show an accurate picture of our work. Social media posts by individuals not associated with our department may show only one part of a larger police interaction. Our focus must remain on the case itself and protecting those who report crimes: survivors, victims, and witnesses. This is especially true with developing incidents/cases in which more information must be sought by investigators. Public assumptions or misinterpretations – even with a popular or viral post – may call for a response. We will be as open as we can as long as an initial or continued response does not negatively impact those we serve or the integrity of a case. We routinely inspect our own work and evaluate the performance of our officers and we make these promises to our community: 1. We will own our mistakes. We are human and we know that we are not perfect. It is important for us to commit ourselves to responsibility and service to our UNT community. 2. We teach every member of our department to understand the customer service mindset inherent to our mission statement and values. 3. We do not investigate ourselves if there is a racial bias allegation made. Those are reviewed by UNT’s Office of Equal Opportunity in the Division of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access. 4. We will continue ongoing training in people skills – such as de-escalation, bias awareness, and bystander intervention – for all officers."
Can I view body/vehicle camera footage of an incident?,"In times of heightened and universal public attention, we may release body or vehicle camera footage alongside our own statements. Other cases, especially those of a sensitive nature or containing important evidentiary value in an ongoing investigation may not be released. There are some instances in which the law requires us to release footage, such as officer-involved shootings (very rare). Most body or vehicle camera footage, at least until the investigation is completed and filed with the District Attorney’s Office, are evidentiary and not for public disclosure. Please note that in addition to body cameras, our officers have cameras inside and outside their vehicles. This footage is regularly reviewed by supervisors so that we might provide training and guidance to officers in order to ensure our best service to the community."
I’m very upset about a social media post/video or incident involving UNT Police. Who can I talk to about this?,"We welcome every opportunity to sit down with our community members to discuss incidents of concern, share as much as we are able, and receive feedback. Please note that if there is a high-profile incident that results in an overwhelming number of inquiries, we can’t always contact or reply to everyone. You can email us at unt.police@unt.edu.. We would appreciate knowing more about you, your organization (if applicable), and how you prefer to meet (in person or virtually). This information is only for meeting purposes so that we may best serve you."
What sort of training do you provide your officers and how often?,"Officers receive all training hours mandated by the State of Texas that are tied to their peace officer credentialing, in addition to many other topics we think are valuable. While the state requires 40 hours of peace officer in-service training every two years, many of our officers get double that… sometimes in a single year! Additionally, our CALEA accreditation standards require other training on a recurring basis, such as bias awareness and use of force. Lastly, we try to pack in as much community-based training as possible. For example, in recent years we’ve trained on responding to needs of persons with Autism, interacting with deaf or hard of hearing individuals, interactions with and understanding our LGBTQ community, and many others."
What happens with my complaint once officers respond and/or how is it investigated?,"After your initial report to one of our officers (or an online submission from our web site), it is reviewed by a supervisor and ultimately forwarded to our criminal investigations group. There it is reviewed again for any follow up needed, investigative work needed, or it is classified and closed. Sometimes an officer may only give advice or not take a report. For these types of interactions, the contact is still logged in our records management system and some notes entered. In either case an incident or case number is generated although officers may only provide the case number if a full report is to be completed. If a case needs an investigative follow-up it is usually assigned to a detective within 1-3 business days and they should contact you to advise you on the status of the case or to get more information."
I am a crime victim at UNT but unsure if I want to report the crime or work with police. What are my other options?,"If you’re unsure, we would still encourage you to talk to an officer (or detective if you already have created a case) and we can guide you through the process of deciding. We have several Federal and State reporting requirements that dictate once we become aware of a crime, we must take a report, even if the crime is not investigated later. The Dean of Students and the Title IX office often help students with situations in ways that operate outside of the criminal justice system. They may provide a good option if you decide to not pursue a criminal case. We can still help you decide and explain what a criminal case/investigation looks like and all the “ins and outs.” Whatever you decide, time is usually of the essence, so call us sooner rather than later and let’s talk it over."
Are you part of Denton Police Department? What are the similarities or differences?,"Even though we work together often, the UNT and Denton Police Departments are actually separate entities. The UNT Police Dept. employs fully licensed police officers who pass and maintain the same state certification as all peace officers in Texas must do. We are responsible for all things UNT-related and investigate crimes occurring on our property. Off-campus or off-property crimes are usually referred to Denton PD, although you may see us operating or assisting in other areas of Denton. We coexist and seamlessly work together on many overlapping incidents in any given week and our Denton PD partners are crucial to our success. Given that we do not have an entire city the size of Denton to patrol and be responsible for, our caseload and activity levels can be less comparatively, but that also allows us to spend time on community needs that might otherwise go unaddressed or simply wouldn’t have time for."
My graduate application has been completed. What am I supposed to do next? Will I be notified about acceptance or the next step required?,"Once your file is complete it will be processed within 2-3 business days (please allow more time during peak registration periods). If your GPA meets the requirements, your file will be forwarded to the department for review and the decision. You will then receive the official admissions letter by mail. If admitted, you will be able to register during the regular registration period through the MyUNT portal page."
I am interested in coming into your undergraduate program and finish up another undergraduate degree. Would I be able to transfer my credits over?,"You will need to apply as a second bachelor degree student. You will need to submit the application along with a fee and an official transcript from every college you've attended. We will then admit you to an undergraduate program so that you can register for undergraduate courses. The undergraduate advisors in your college of interest will be able to schedule an appointment with you to determine which courses will transfer towards your new degree and which courses you still need to complete."
How can I apply to the school to take 2 or 3 undergraduate classes this fall without applying to the graduate school?,"Although you wish to only take a few undergraduate courses, you will still need to apply through the Graduate Admissions Office for admission. You will need to apply as a second bachelor degree student. You will need to submit the application along with a fee and an official transcript from every college you've attended. We will then admit you to an undergraduate program so that you can register for undergraduate courses."
I hold a master’s degree with at least a 3.5 GPA. Do I still need to submit my other transcripts?,"Yes. We require an official transcript from every college you've attended, even if you already hold an advanced degree."
I would like to take one graduate course at UNT. Do I have to apply to the graduate school?,"Yes, you will need to apply for admission through the Graduate School. You will need to submit an application, pay the fee and submit all official transcripts from schools attended. Since you only want to take one course, you can apply as a non-degree seeking student. This will allow you admission based solely on your GPA. If you need financial aid, please contact their office before applying to this status to discuss your eligibility."
Where can I find the forms to file a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy?,"The forms are located at https://vpaa.unt.edu/ss/integrity. Use the Academic Violation Report - Single Violation form for EACH violation. Each violation needs to be filed individually, even if the assignments were due on the same day. A report should be filed if an instructor decides that a preponderance of evidence shows the student violated the policy."
I suspect a student used artificial intelligence to complete their work. What do I select for violation type?,"Based on the Student Academic Integrity Policy (UNT Policy 6.003), any form of 'unauthorized assistance' constitutes cheating. If the use of artificial intelligence is not authorized for the assignment in question, the violation is 'cheating'."
Why do I have to file these forms?,"The faculty, administration, and students all have had input on the formulation of Student Academic Integrity Policy (UNT Policy 6.003). The university has deemed academic integrity a value intrinsic to education and to the validity of a UNT degree. Therefore, cases must be reported to the Academic Integrity Office for each violation."
Do I have to file a separate report for every violation for the policy even if it is for the same student?,"No. You may now file one form for multiple violations so long as the violations were all part of a single incident on a single date. For example, if you are reporting that a student cheated and also facilitated academic dishonesty on a single exam, you can file a single report. If you are reporting cheating on multiple exams, you will need to file multiple reports. The Academic Integrity Office may take additional actions for major or multiple violations of the Academic Integrity Policy. The student has the due process right to appeal each violation separately."
Do I have to meet with the student before filing the violation form?,"Yes, you need to meet with the student in person, or on a video platform like Zoom, or via phone, or possibly by email (least desirable) to give the student the opportunity to tell their side of the story. If the student does not respond to you within 5 business days or declines the meeting, you may file the form and indicate that the student did not respond or that they responded and then declined. When you contact the student about the possible violation, please indicate you have reason to believe the student has been involved in an Academic Integrity violation."
How much time do I have to file the form after the violation occurred?,"The policy states that the instructor should contact the student and discuss the allegations with them 'as soon as possible.' If the instructor decides to file the form after that meeting, the instructor also should file it 'as soon as possible.' Our guidance is to file as soon as you identify the violation."
Can the Academic Integrity Office tell me what happened to the student after I filed the report? Can you tell me if the student has previous violations?,"No. Under FERPA guidelines, the AI Office is not at liberty to disclose that information, nor can the AI office disclose any additional sanctions assigned, or the result of any appeal the student files."
What happens if the student appeals the violation?,"The information will go to the chair of the department, who will gather information and make a ruling on the appeal. Some chairs have formed a committee who will hear the appeal and issue a ruling. For this reason, you should avoid discussing the violation with your chair until you determine whether the student is appealing. Should you wish to discuss the issue to get feedback, we prefer you contact the AI office."
Is UNT offering in person and virtual campus tours?,"We are offering in-person walking tours and guided virtual tours at this time. The in-person walking tours last about 90 minutes and includes a decent amount of walking, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes and check the weather before heading to campus."
Will my tour guide be a student?,"Yes. Our students are what make UNT special! Student ambassadors will guide you on your in-person walking tour. Our student ambassadors are also your guide for the virtual tour. If you would like to speak to one of our student ambassadors about student life at UNT, please call 940-565-4104 or send us an email at ambassador@unt.edu."
I’m excited to learn more about UNT! Can I talk to someone and learn more about campus life and the student experience?,"Yes, absolutely. We are so glad you asked! Our admissions counselors are available to provide answers to your questions. You can reach them at 940-565-2681 or visit our Ways to Connect resource page! In addition, if you would like to speak to one of our student Eagle Ambassadors about student life at UNT, please call 940-565-4104 or send us an email at ambassador@unt.edu."
Can I attend UNT as a Pre-Music major?,"No, Pre-Music (PMUS) is not a major program. Rather, the university uses the code “PMUS” as an admissions marker for students who plan on completing an audition to major in music before enrolling at UNT. If you are unable to successfully audition prior to enrolling, the Exploring Majors Advising Team may assist you in declaring a major."
How do I change my major to Music?,"All students must apply to the College of Music prior to declaring a music major. Please visit the College of Music Admissions website for more information."
How do I change my major to something other than Music?,"A list of campus advising offices is available online at https://vpaa.unt.edu/advising/advising-offices Start by reviewing the advising website for your intended major to learn more about how to declare a new major."
How do I declare a music minor?,"Non-music majors hoping to minor in Music may ask their major advisor to add the general music minor to their degree plan. More information on declaring a minor in Music Business and Entrepreneurship or a minor in Commercial Music is available online. Music majors hoping to declare a minor in Music Theory may do so with their academic advisor after successfully completing Music Theory III."
Should I schedule an advising appointment or may I just drop-in for advising?,"We welcome drop-ins and also have appointment availability. Current students may drop-in for academic advising in person in Chilton Hall room 211 between 8:00 AM and 4:30 PM Monday through Friday, excluding campus holidays. Virtual drop-ins and Scheduled appointments are available via the Navigate app."
Can I get advised over the phone or email?,"General questions may be answered over the phone or email. In some cases, an appointment may be required. Please email Music.Advising@unt.edu if you are unable to meet with an advisor during business hours."
Can I request a specific advisor?,"You may request a specific advisor when scheduling an appointment via the Navigate app. However, this option is not available for Drop-in appointments."
How do I prepare for my appointment?,"We encourage you to review the registration guide, your online degree audit, and the semester-by-semester plan for your degree(s). We also ask that you begin completing your Advising Record so that your advisor may review it during your appointment. The College of Music Advising Basics Canvas course details these resources."
Why do I have an Advising Hold?,"New students will have an advising hold for the first few semesters at UNT to ensure you are familiar with advising resources and registration practices. Other reasons for an Advising Hold will appear in your MyUNT Tasks Icon."
What does it mean when I get the message No valid appointment time?,"You will receive this message if you attempt to enroll before your registration time has begun or if the registration system is closed for payment processing. Registration opens based on class standing. Please visit the term Registration Guide for more details."
How do I register for my private lessons?,"Private lessons are a class that you will add to your schedule each semester. Performance students enroll in “MUAM” lessons while Concentration students (majoring in Composition, Jazz, Music Education, BA Music) enroll in “MUAC” lessons. Prior to passing the Upper Division Exam (UDE) Jury, students enroll in 1500-level lessons. After passing the UDE, students enroll in 3500-level lessons. Corresponding numbers for each instrument may be found in the university catalog."
How do I add secondary lessons?,"You may request secondary lessons by contacting the Instrumental Studies office for winds, strings, and percussion lessons. You may contact the Voice and Keyboard office to request voice, piano, organ, or harpsichord secondary lessons."
How do I enroll for an ensemble if auditions haven’t occurred yet?,"You may enroll in the “holding section” until after auditions. Please refer to the Registration Guide for more information on holding sections."
What does the error message Maximum Term Unit Load Exceeded mean?,"If you get this message, you have tried to register for more than the maximum number of credit hours allowed for the term. In the Spring or Fall terms, the maximum number of credit hours allowed is 19. An advisor may review your eligibility for an overload."
Can I enroll in a full class?,"While rare, advisors may be able to add you a full class with departmental and/or instructor approval if fire code will not be violated. We recommend that you waitlist a full class prior to asking for an exception to be added to a full class. Music advisors are not able to add you to full non-music courses."
How do I waitlist a class?,"The waitlist feature allows students to place themselves on a wait list for a class section that is full. As seats open up in the class, the waitlist process will run to auto-enroll students according to their position number until the final day of the Add/Drop Registration period. If a class is accepting students onto the wait list, a yellow triangle will appear. Select the class, check the box to “Waitlist if class is full” option and continue enrolling. You will receive confirmation of your position on the waitlist once you have completed enrolling. You may monitor your position on the waitlist via MyUNT. Please note: Waitlisted courses are not counted towards your enrollment totals unless/until you are officially enrolled."
May I remain enrolled in my current section but waitlist a different section?,"If you wish to remain enrolled in your current section until space becomes available in a closed section, you must enroll in the waitlisted section using the “SWAP” feature."
Why didn’t the waitlist feature enroll me once a seat opened?,"The requirements to be moved off the waitlist are the same as standard enrollment. You will not be enrolled in more units than permitted in that term. You will not be enrolled if you have not met prerequisites, if you have registration holds, or if you are already enrolled in a different section of the same class and did not schedule the class using the Swap function."
How many classes should I take each semester?,"Most courses are worth three credits, but be sure to check for each of your courses. You must be a full-time student to live in campus housing and get full financial aid, which means taking at least 12 credits per semester (typically four classes). Most students take at least 15 credits per semester and some take 17 or more. One idea is to check the UNT Catalog or the number of hours required to graduate with your major (or a typical one, if you do not have a major yet) and divide that number by four. That is the number of credits you will need to earn each year to graduate in four years."
How many hours per week can I work at a job of some kind and still be a successful student?,"A study from the American Council on Education indicates that students who work from 1-15 hours per week are less likely to drop out of college than those who work 15 or more hours or not at all."
How much studying will it take to do well in my college classes?,"Each person is different, of course, but the rule of thumb is that you should study two to three hours for each hour you spend in class. Some classes will demand more time, others less. One helpful hint: try not to get behind in a class, as it may be impossible to catch up later."
How many Honors courses can I take during one semester?,"You may take as many or as few as you like, provided you successfully complete at least one Honors course each academic year (two for many scholarship holders)."
Are Honors classes more difficult than regular classes?,"Honors classes are different rather than just more difficult. They are intended to provide an intellectual challenge while offering opportunities for you to be actively involved in your learning. Many students find Honors courses more enjoyable than others because the small class size allows for an in-depth discussion of the course material and special projects. However, some subjects are more difficult than others and students differ in talents and interests, so it is hard to generalize."
What type of tests should I expect in Honors classes?,"Tests in Honors classes tend to demand that you know facts, of course, but also that you understand ideas and concepts. Most professors require essays as part of their tests, but subjects and professors differ, so be sure you are clear on what the professors in your particular classes want you to know."
Will I have a better GPA if I avoid Honors classes?,"Honors students typically excel in their classes, or they would not be part of the program. Honors classes provide a challenging but supportive atmosphere, so most Honors students continue to maintain high grades. The creative structure and engaging nature of Honors classes generally motivate students to do well."
Where can I find the most accurate listing of available Honors classes?,"The Registrar's website list Honors classes each semester and the Honors College posts a listing at honors.unt.edu."
Will my 3000 and 4000 level Honors classes count toward my major?,"Whether these classes count toward your major has to do with each department’s major requirements. Some of our 3000 and 4000 level classes are in a specific discipline; others, such as Honors 4100, are colloquia and may count only toward a major with agreement from the department."
When should I make my choice about which Honors College award to work toward?,"You should meet with the academic counselor during your first semester in the Honors College and devise a plan. You can change the award level you are seeking at any time."
What is a four-year plan?,"It is a plan to graduate in four years, with the major of your choice as well as the Honors College Award you want to earn. We urge our students to apply themselves, make good choices about the courses they take and graduate in a timely manner. The Honors College Academic Counselors will show each student the various Honors options and work out a plan for the classes the student has left to take to fulfill the Honors option that the student desires. Students are required to make and attend an advising appointment with the Honors College Academic Counselors during their first semester in Honors."
Do I have to take HNRS 1500 as a prerequisite for the more advanced Honors Research classes?,"No, but it is highly recommended. HNRS 1500 sets the stage for the thesis proposal and thesis writing courses. Students who take HNRS 1500 are typically more prepared than others to undertake their thesis work."
Can I get credit for a thesis and a thesis replacement?,"No, Honors credit is given for one or the other, but not both."
Is Honors open to graduate students or students working on their second baccalaureate (post-baccalaureate)?,"No, Honors is a program for undergraduates only."
What happens if my semester and/or cumulative Grade Point Average drops below 3.00?,"Should your GPA fall to between 2.00 and 3.00, you will go on probation for the upcoming semester. During that time, you will still be eligible for all the benefits of Honors membership while you work to bring your GPA up. If your GPA remains between 2.00 and 3.00 for two semesters, your Honors College membership will become inactive and you cannot enjoy any of the benefits of Honors College membership. You can return to active membership by raising your GPA to 3.00 or higher.\nIf your GPA falls below 2.00, you are immediately placed on inactive status and may be dropped from Honors College membership."
If I remain active in the Honors College throughout my undergraduate career but do not achieve an award will my active stats be noted on my transcript?,"No, active status will not be noted on one's transcript, only the specific honors distinction or award will be noted, if achieved. However, honors-specific courses will be included on your transcript along with other courses and active members are still eligible for membership benefits."
I can't find parking anywhere - I hear you oversell lots. How am I supposed to find parking?,"Each year, we have hundreds of open spaces in Lot 20 (formerly Fouts Field). We highly recommend that as a backup parking lot if you find the lot you prefer to use is full. While we do sell slightly more parking permits that we have spaces, please note that not all community members are using the parking lots at the same times. For example, there are evening faculty and staff who only use lots after 5 pm. We also see increased parking lot usage on Tuesdays and Thursdays - but even on our busiest days we still have plenty of parking available in Lot 20. If you need assistance to campus from Lot 20, Mean Green buses regularly run routes around campus and are ADA accessible."
I'm moving into/moving out of a residence hall - where should I park to unload/load my items?,"You may see cars parking just outside of the residence halls in fire lanes. We don't recommend that as it is unsafe and can cause an issue should there be a need for an emergency vehicle. Typically, all parking lots next to a residence hall - with the exception of “A” (green) and “RR” (orange and black striped) parking lots - are open during move in weekend. If you need to move in or move out earlier than the designated weekends, please call our office to make arrangements. Call us at 940-565-3020."
I have a rental car/am using another car - how do I transfer my parking permit so I don't get a citation?,"UNT parking permits are made of a cling material rather than a permanent sticky material. That way, you can easily switch them between cars. Please be sure that the license plates of all cars you use are registered in your account through the Parking Portal. Please remember that there is no sharing of permits - one permit per person."
I ordered my permit nearly a month ago and it hasn't come yet - what do I do?,"For those who order their permits prior to July for the following fall semester, our permit service doesn't begin shipping permits until mid- to late-July. If you haven't received your permit by August, please let us know at (940) 565-3020. You may have to come into our office to receive a new permit.\nFor those who are ordering permits for immediate use or in August for the fall semester, you will have an option to print a temporary parking permit (PDF) in your Parking Portal account. This is typically valid for up to 30 days. If you do not receive your permit after 15 days, please call us or visit our office on the first floor of the Highland Street Garage."
I logged onto the Parking Portal but I cannot buy a permit/cannot buy the permit I want - what do I do?,"Please call us at (940) 565-3020, email us at transportation.services@unt.edu or visit our office from 7:30 am to 5:30 pm Monday through Friday. In some instances we may need to connect your account to the proper authorization that allows you to buy a specific permit."
Where does my permit or citation money go?,"The major uses of parking funds include parking lot construction and maintenance. In 2018 and in 2019, new parking lots were built. In 2011, the Highland Street Garage was constructed. Funds we receive help pay off the debt on those assets. Funds are also used for our staffing and operations."
I'm worried about using the buses - how can I learn more about them?,"We recommend starting with our explainer of bus route maps and the service schedule on the Campus Transit page. Please note that times listed on the schedule are departure times. Please feel free to chat with Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA) bus drivers when using the bus so they can help you prepare for your stop. It's also a good idea to connect with us and with other students who ride the bus if you have specific questions. Call us at (940) 565-3020 or email us at transportation.services@unt.edu."
I missed my bus/the bus passed me by - how can I get better service?,"We highly recommend you download the Transit app. This is the app used by DCTA buses that tracks their whereabouts so that you know when the bus is getting closer. Please be aware that at certain times of the year - such as the first two weeks of school - and on certain days - namely, Tuesday and Thursday - we see an increased ridership. If a bus is full, they might pass you by. We suggest preparing to catch an earlier bus to avoid this from happening. If you feel a bus has passed you by unfairly or if the service is not what you expect, please fill out a DCTA GoRequest. This will connect you directly with a DCTA representative that will look into your concern and get back to you."
How can you afford to let students ride the buses for free?,"Students actually pay for this service - so we encourage you to use it! The Transportation Fee was started in 2003 to support bus service for students since many apartments were expanding out of the immediate UNT area. In order to alleviate parking traffic and give our students safe and reliable transit, UNT implemented the fee to support transportation to and from campus. Your Transportation Fee supports bus service on UNT campus routes and allows students to ride Denton city buses for free by showing their UNT student ID."
